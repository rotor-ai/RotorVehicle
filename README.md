# Rotor Vehicle

The RotorVehicle library provides an architecture for controlling an Android-based autonomous vehicle. The Rotor can either be controlled manually from a client, or in autonomous mode (coming soon). 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The RotorVehicle library has been tested with the following configuration:
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 3
- OS: Android Things 1.0.6

Additional Hardware:
- Android or iOS device running the Rotor `mobileclient` library (https://github.com/rotor-ai/mobileclient)
- Arduino running the `RotorArduino` motor controller library (https://github.com/rotor-ai/RotorArduino)
- RC car with PWM speed control and servo for steering - a good starting point is the Exceed Short Course Desert Truck ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Exceed-Racing-Desert-Course-2-4ghz/dp/9269802108/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Exceed+Racing+Desert+Short+Course+Truck&qid=1554669149&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-1-fkmrnull))

To fully implement the Rotor system, it must be used in conjunction with the `mobileclient` and the

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
