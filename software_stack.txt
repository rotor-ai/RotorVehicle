rotor.ai software stack
=======================

Layer-3: AI Agent (and/or) Mobile Client
    
    Responsibilities:
        * Directing the vehicle where to go and what to actuate (turn left, accelerate, brake)
        * Allow for Human to take control away from AI at any time.
        * AI can only be engaged by Human.

Layer-2: Raspberry Pi
    
    Responsibilities:
        * Forwards inputs from Layer-3 to Layer-2
        * Provide lightweight computation for the AI Agent
        * Will eventually capture video data and forward info to the AI Agent
        * On-board logging of everything that happens (like an airplane black box)

Layer-1: Arduino + Speed controller

    Responsibilities:
        * Converts throttle and steering inputs from the RPI into usable PWM values for the hardware

Layer-0: Motors/Servos/Actuators/Sensors

    Responsibilities:
        * Respond to electrical signals from the speed controller & Arduino
        * Accurately take measurements for Layer-1 (example: ultrasonic sensors, gyroscope, accelerometer)

Note: We will plan to allow constant values (like trim & calibration values) to be passed from Layer-3 all the way down to Layer-1.
